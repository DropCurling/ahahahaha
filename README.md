A text based game based off of a DND campaign a friend made

It's very unfinished, so this README.md file and the .EXE will be changing a lot over the next couple months

You'll probably get a virus warning when you download this, which is a good thing because it's just a random .exe file

Rest assured because I wont try to murder your computer (or will I?!?)
